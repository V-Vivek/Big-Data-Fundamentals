# The Master-Slave Database Concept
- It is a general way to optimise IO in a system where number of requests goes way high that a single DB server is not able to handle it efficiently.
- Master acts as the primary source of data, while one or more other databases, known as slaves, receive and store a copy of the data from the master. 
- ***Master is responsible for all write operations (insert, update, delete)***.  
- ***Slaves are responsible for read operations (select)***.

# Replication Methods

## Synchronous replication
- In this method, the master writes data to its local disk and simultaneously sends the data to the slave. 
- The ***slave acknowledges receipt of the data before the master considers the write operation complete***. 
- This method provides the highest level of data consistency and reliability, as the slave and master have identical copies of the data at all times. 
- However, it ***may also result in slower write performance*** due to the time taken for the acknowledgment from the slave.

## Asynchronous replication
- In this method, the master writes data to its local disk and immediately sends the data to the slave. 
- The ***slave does not acknowledge receipt of the data, and the master considers the write operation complete*** once it has been written to its local disk. 
- This method provides improved write performance, as the master does not have to wait for an acknowledgment from the slave. 
- However, it ***may result in some data loss or inconsistency*** in the event of a failure, as the slave may not have received the latest updates from the master.
