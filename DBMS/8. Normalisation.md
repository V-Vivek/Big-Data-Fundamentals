# Normalisation
- It is a Database optimisation technique.
- Normalisation is a step towards DB optimisation.
- Helps to avoid redundancy in the DB.
- Normalisation divides the composite attributes into individual attributes OR larger table into smaller and links them using relationships.
- It is also used to eliminate undesirable characteristics like Insertion, Update and Deletion Anomalies.

# What happen if we have redundant data?
- Insertion, deletion and updation anomalies arises.
- Due to these anomalies, DB size increases and DB performance becomes very slow.

# Anomalies (Abnormalities)
- ***Insertion anomaly***:
  - When certain data (attribute) can not be inserted into the DB without the presence of other data.
  - e.g. In above table we cannot add a new branch unless we have a student for that branch. 

- ***Deletion anomaly***:
  - The delete anomaly refers to the situation where the deletion of data results in the unintended loss of some other important data.
  - In above table if we delete Student with id = 6, the M.E. branch will also get deleted

- ***Updation (Modification) anomaly***:
  - The update anomaly is when an update of a single data value requires multiple rows of data to be updated.
  - Due to updation to many places, may be Data inconsistency arises, if one forgets to update the data at all the intended places.
  - In above table if we want to change Branch code of CS branch we have to change it in multiple rows.

# Types of Normalisation

  ## 1. 1NF
  - Every relation cell must have atomic value.
  - Relation must not have multi-valued attributes.
  - Redundancy is acceptable in 1NF.

  ## 2NF
  - Relation must be in 1NF.
  - There should not be any partial dependency.
    1. All non-prime attributes must be fully dependent on PK.
    2. Non prime attribute can not depend on the part of the PK.
  - e.g. Below denormalised table has {StudentID, projID} as primary key.
  - StudentID can determine StudentName
  - ProjectID can determine ProjectName
  - This means non-prime attributes are dependent on part of PK. (Partial Dependancy)

  - Below normalised table solves the problem by creating 2 separate tables

  ## 3NF
  - Relation must be in 2NF.
  - No transitivity dependency exists.
    1. Non-prime attribute should not find a non-prime attribute.
