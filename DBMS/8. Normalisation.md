# Normalisation
- It is a Database optimisation technique.
- Normalisation is a step towards DB optimisation.
- Helps to avoid redundancy in the DB.

# What happen if we have redundant data?
- Insertion, deletion and updation anomalies arises.
- Due to these anomalies, DB size increases and DB performance becomes very slow.

# Anomalies (Abnormalities)
- ***Insertion anomaly***:
  - When certain data (attribute) can not be inserted into the DB without the presence of other data.
  - e.g. In above table we cannot add a new branch unless we have a student for that branch. 

- ***Deletion anomaly***:
  - The delete anomaly refers to the situation where the deletion of data results in the unintended loss of some other important data.
  - In above table if we delete Student with id = 6, the M.E. branch will also get deleted

- ***Updation (Modification) anomaly***:
  - The update anomaly is when an update of a single data value requires multiple rows of data to be updated.
  - Due to updation to many places, may be Data inconsistency arises, if one forgets to update the data at all the intended places.
  - In above table if we want to change Branch code of CS branch we have to change it in multiple rows.
