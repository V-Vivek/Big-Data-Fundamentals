# Steps to make ER diagram
1. Identify Entity sets
2. Identify attributes & their types
3. Identify Relationships & their constraints

# Sample ER Model of Banking System

#### Requirement Engineering

- Bank -> Branches -> Customers -> Accounts & Loans
- Bank -> Employees
- Employees -> Associated with Customers

## 1. Entity sets:
- Branch
- Customer
- Employee
- Savings Account
- Current Account

## 2. Attributes:
- Branch -> name(primary key), city(string), assets(int), liabilities(int)
- Customer -> cust_id(primary key), name(string), address(composite), contact_no(multi-valued), DOB(single-valued), age(dervied)
- Employee -> emp_id(primary key), name(string), contact_no(multi-valued), dependant_name(multi-valued), start_date(single-valued), years_of_experience(dervied)
- Account -> acc_no, balance
  - Savings account -> interest_rate, daily_withdrawl_limit
  - Current account -> per_transaction_charges, overdraft_amount
- Loan -> loan_number, amount
- Payment(weak entity) -> payment_no, date, amount

## 3. Relationship & Constraints:
- Customer -*-borrow-*- Loan -> M:N
- Loan -*-originated by-*- Branch -> N:1
- Loan -*-consists-*- Payments -> 1:N
- Customer -*-deposits in-*- Account -> M:N
- Customer -*-banker-*- Employee -> N:1
