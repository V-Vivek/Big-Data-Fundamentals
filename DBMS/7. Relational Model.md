# ER Model VS Relational Model
- Enity set -> converts to -> Table
- Enitity attributes -> converts to -> Column names
- Entity relations -> converts to -> Foreign keys

# Relational Model
- Relational Model (RM) organises the data in the form of relations (tables).
- A relational DB consists of collection of tables, each of which is assigned a unique name.

# Terminologies
- ***Tuple***: A single row of the table representing a single data point / a unique record.
- ***Columns***: Represents the attributes of the relation.
- ***Relation Schema***: Defines the design and structure of the relation, contains the name of the relation and all the columns/attributes.
- ***Degree of table***: Number of attributes/columns in a given table/relation.
- ***Cardinality***: Total no. of tuples in a given relation.

# Sample Table

+-------------+  
| Customers   |  
+-------------+  
| customer_id |  
| name        |  
| email       |  
| phone       |  
| address     |  
+-------------+  

# Relational Model Keys
- ***Super Key (SK)***: 
  - Any Permutation & Combination of attributes present in a table which can uniquely identify each tuple.
  - e.g. {customer_id}, {customer_id, name}, {customer_id, email}, {name, email}, {phone, address}, {customer_id, name, phone}, etc.

- ***Candidate Key (CK)***: 
  - Minimum subset of super keys, which can uniquely identify each tuple. It contains no redundant attribute.
  - CK value shouldnâ€™t be NULL.
  - For e.g. in above super key name attribute is redundant as customers can have same name.
  - e.g. {customer_id}, {email}, {phone}, {email, phone}, {cutomer_id, email}, {customer_id, address}, etc.
- ***Primary Key (PK)***:
  - Selected out of CK set, which has the least no. of attributes.
  - e.g. {customer_id}
 
- ***Alternate Key (AK)***:
  - All CK except PK

- ***Foreign Key (FK)***:
  - It creates relation between two tables
  - It is a primary key of another table

- ***Composite Key***: 
  - PK formed using at least 2 attributes.
- ***Compound Key***: 
  - PK which is formed using 2 FK.
- ***Surrogate Key***:
  - Synthetic PK.
  - Generated automatically by DB, usually an integer value.
  - May be used as PK.
  - e.g Consider user joins 2 tables having similar primary key with similar data inside them. To avoid inconsistency we can use Surrogate Key as PK.
