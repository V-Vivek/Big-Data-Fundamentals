# Specialization

- It is the process of creating a subtype of an entity from a supertype entity by defining a set of constraints. 
- The subtype entity, also known as a specialized entity, inherits the attributes and relationships of the supertype entity
- But also has additional attributes and constraints that are specific to that subtype.
- We have 'is-a' relationship between superclass & subclass.
- It is a ***Top Down*** approach

# Generalisation

- It is the process of creating a supertype entity from one or more subtype entities by defining a set of common characteristics or attributes.
- It is similar to ***Specialization***
- But it is reverse of ***Specialization*** in terms of thinking i.e. first we create subtype of entity & then create supertye
- It is a ***Bottom Up*** approach
