# Entity-Relationship Model

 - It is a way of visually representing the ***data and the relationships between entities*** in a database. 
 - The model is composed of entities, which represent ***real-world objects*** or concepts, and the relationships between them.
 - The ER model is used to design and represent the logical structure of a database, and it is a key tool in the process of database design.


## Entity

- An Entity is a “thing” or “object” in the real world that is distinguishable from all other objects.
- Entity can be uniquely identified. (By a primary attribute, aka Primary Key)


## Entity set

- It is a set of entities of the same type that share the same properties or attributes.


## Attributes

- An entity is represented by a set of attributes.
- Each entity has a value for each of its attributes.
- Types of attributes:
    1. ***Simple attributes***: These are the basic attributes that describe an entity, such as name, ID, and address.
    2. ***Composite attributes***: These are attributes that are made up of multiple simple attributes, such as full name, which is made up of first name and last name.
    3. ***Derived attributes***: These are attributes that can be calculated or derived from other attributes, such as age, which can be calculated from a person's birthdate.
    4. ***Multi-valued attributes***: These are attributes that can have multiple values, such as a person's phone numbers or email addresses.
    5. ***Stored attributes***: These are attributes that are stored in the database and can be retrieved when needed, such as a person's address.
    6. ***Null attributes***: These are attributes that do not have a value or can be null, such as a person's middle name.


## Relationships

- A relationship is a connection or association between two or more entities. 
- Relationships are represented by a diamond shape and are connected to the entities that they involve.
