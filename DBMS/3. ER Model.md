# Entity-Relationship Model

 - It is a way of visually representing the ***data and the relationships between entities*** in a database. 
 - The model is composed of entities, which represent ***real-world objects*** or concepts, and the relationships between them.
 - The ER model is used to design and represent the logical structure of a database, and it is a key tool in the process of database design.


## Entity

- An Entity is a “thing” or “object” in the real world that is distinguishable from all other objects.
- Entity can be uniquely identified. (By a primary attribute, aka Primary Key)


## Entity set

- It is a set of entities of the same type that share the same properties or attributes.


## Attributes

- An entity is represented by a set of attributes.
- Each entity has a value for each of its attributes.
- Types of attributes:
    1. ***Simple attributes***: These are the basic attributes that describe an entity, such as name, ID, and address.
    2. ***Composite attributes***: These are attributes that are made up of multiple simple attributes, such as full name, which is made up of first name and last name.
    3. ***Derived attributes***: These are attributes that can be calculated or derived from other attributes, such as age, which can be calculated from a person's birthdate.
    4. ***Multi-valued attributes***: These are attributes that can have multiple values, such as a person's phone numbers or email addresses.
    5. ***Stored attributes***: These are attributes that are stored in the database and can be retrieved when needed, such as a person's address.
    6. ***Null attributes***: These are attributes that do not have a value or can be null, such as a person's middle name.


## Relationships

- A relationship is a connection or association between two or more entities. 
- Relationships are represented by a diamond shape and are connected to the entities that they involve.

### Strong relationship:

- It is one in which the ***existence of one entity depends on the existence of another entity***. 
- ***For example***: There may be an entity for "Student" and an entity for "Enrollment". 
- A strong relationship between these two entities would indicate that a student can only exist if they are enrolled in at least one course
- And an enrollment can only exist if there is a student enrolled.

### Weak relationship:

- It is one in which the ***existence of one entity does not depend on the existence of another entity***.
- ***For example***: There may be an entity for "Student" and an entity for "Course". 
- A weak relationship between these two entities would indicate that a student can exist without being enrolled in any course
- And a course can exist without having any students enrolled.

In short, In strong relationship the primary key of one table becomes the foreign key of another table and it's mandatory. while in weak relationship the primary key of one table can or cannot be foreign key of another table, and it's optional.

## Relationship Constraints

### Mapping Cardinality

Mapping cardinality refers to the process of defining the number of entities in one entity set that can be associated with the entities in another entity set, based on the relationships between them.


 - One-to-One (1:1) mapping
 - One-to-Many (1:N) mapping
 - Many-to-Many (M:N) mapping
