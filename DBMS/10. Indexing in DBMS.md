# Indexing
- Indexing is used to optimise the performance of a database by minimising the number of disk accesses required when a query is processed.
- The index is a type of data structure. It is used to locate and access the data in a database table quickly.
- Speeds up operation with read operations like SELECT queries, WHERE clause etc.

# Terminologies
- ***Search Key:*** A specific attribute or combination of attributes used to search and retrieve data from a database.
- ***Data Reference:*** Pointer holding the address of disk block where the value of the corresponding key is stored.
- ***Index file:*** Table containig Search Key & Data Reference. Index file is always sorted.
- ***Block/Page:*** A block is a collection of data that is stored together on disk

# Types of Indexing

## 1. Primary Index (Clustering Index)
- Used when data file is sorted
- Subtypes:
  - ***Dense Index***
    - Used when there are duplicate values in Searck key attribute/column.
    - All unique Search keys are present in the Index file
    - Data Reference points to the first occurance of the Search key

  - ***Sparse Index***
    - Used when there is no duplication in Serach key attribute/column.
    - Not all the serach key column values are present. Sampled search key values are peresnt.
    - Data Reference points to the start of the block

## 2. Secondary Index (Non-Clustering Index)
- Datafile is unsorted. Hence, Primary Indexing is not possible.
- Called secondary indexing because normally one indexing is already applied.
- No. Of entries in the index file = no. of records in the data file.
- It's an example of Dense index.
