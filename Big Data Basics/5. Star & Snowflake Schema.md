# Star Schema
- A star schema is a type of data model where one or more fact tables are surrounded by dimension tables, forming a star-like structure. 
- The fact table contains the measures or facts that you want to analyze, and the dimension tables provide context for the measures. 
- The relationships between the fact table and dimension tables are typically one-to-many. 
- This design allows for fast and efficient querying of the data, ***as the data is denormalized***.

# Snowflake Schema
- A snowflake schema is a type of data model that ***normalizes the dimension tables***, resulting in a more complex structure than the star schema. 
- In a snowflake schema, the dimension tables are related to each other, rather than just the fact table. 
- This normalization ***reduces data redundancy*** and allows for better data management
- But can ***lead to slower querying performance***, as the data needs to be joined across multiple tables.
