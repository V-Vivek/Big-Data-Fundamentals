## OLTP (Online Transaction Processing)
  - Designed to handle a large number of short transactions, such as inserting, updating, and deleting data.
  - Optimized for fast data retrieval and data manipulation, and they typically use a ***normalized data model*** to minimize data redundancy.
  - They supprot ACID properties & main goal is to capture data in real time.
  - Typically used in operational environments, such as retail stores, banks and e-commerce websites.
  - e.g. RDBMS - MySQL, Oracle, PostgreSQL, etc.

## OLAP (Online Analytical Processing)  
  - Designed for analytical and reporting purposes.
  - Used to analyze large amounts of historical data and provide insights into the data.
  - Optimized for fast query performance and are typically built on top of a ***data warehouse or data mart***.
  - Uses a ***denormalized data model***, which allows for faster query performance at the cost of increased data redundancy.
  - It doesn;t care about ACID properties.
  - e.g. AWS Redshift, Hive, NoSQL, etc.

# Summary
  - In short, OLTP systems are focused on managing and processing transactions, while OLAP systems are focused on providing fast and flexible access to data for analytical and reporting purposes. 
  - The two systems are often used in conjunction to support business operations, with OLTP systems capturing and managing transactional data and OLAP systems providing analytical capabilities on that data.
