# Data Lake

- A Data lake is a centralized repository that allows you to store all your structured and unstructured data at any scale. 
- It is a scalable and flexible data management solution that enables us to store, process, and analyze large amounts of raw data in its ***native format***. 
- Data lakes are typically built using distributed file systems and big data technologies, such as Hadoop and Spark.

# Data Warehouse

- A Data warehouse is a relational database management system that is optimized for reporting and analytics. 
- It is designed to support the efficient querying and analysis of large amounts of historical data. 
- Data warehousing involves the process of collecting, storing, managing and analyzing data from various sources to support business decision making. 
- Data warehouses use a multidimensional data model, which allows for fast query performance and data analysis.

# Data Mart

- A Data Mart is a ***subset of a larger Data Warehouse*** that is focused on a specific business function or department. 
- It is a smaller version of a Data Warehouse, which contains a subset of the data and is optimized for a specific business area or department.
- Data Marts are often used in organizations with a large amount of data, where it is not feasible to store and analyze all the data in a single Data Warehouse. 
- They provide a more cost-effective and efficient way to manage data, as they only store the data that is needed by a specific department or business unit.
