# Data Integration
- Data integration is the process of combining data from multiple sources into a single, unified view. 
- The process of data integration includes a number of different steps, including
  ## Data Extraction
    - To extract data from one or more sources. This can include databases, flat files, or other systems.
    - The extracted data is usually stored in a staging area for further processing

  ## Data Transformation
    - It involves cleaning, validating, and transforming the data so that it is ready for loading into the destination system.
    - The transformation step can include tasks such as removing duplicates, converting data types, or calculating new values.

  ## Data Loading
  - To load the transformed data into the destination system. 
  - This can include a data warehouse, a data lake, or another system. 
  - The loaded data is then typically available for reporting, analysis, and other business processes.

  ## Data Quality Management
  - This step involves monitoring, identifying and correcting errors and inconsistencies in data
  - To ensure that the data is accurate and reliable.
  
  ## Data Governance
  - To ensure that the data is properly managed and protected throughout the data integration process
  - And ensures that data is being used in compliance with regulatory and legal requirements.
