# MapReduce

## Map
- Reads blocks/data and generate (key,value) pairs.

## Reduce
- Reads (key,value) data generated by map phase and aggregates the result. Final result will be also in (key,value) format.

## Map Reduce Execution Flow

## Input Data
- It is input files or refernce to the data stored in HDFS.

## Input Format
- Defines how the input files are read from source or how to serialize or deserialize them properly

## Input Splits
- Logical representation of the data which will be processed by an individual Mapper task
- One Map task is created for each input split.
- Data Block vs Input Split
  - ***Block:*** Actual unit where raw data will be stored physically
  - ***Input Splits:*** It is like a reference to the original block of data.

## Record Reader
- It communicates with the Input Splits & converts the data into key-value pairs.
- For e.g. It will convert memory address as a key & data inside that address as a value.
